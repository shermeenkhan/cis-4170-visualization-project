# Data Visualization Project for CIS 4170 Class

## As part of my final project for my data visualization class, I looked at Netflix Movies/TV dataset. I'd like to understand more about the Netflix Content offered including:

#### - What type of content does Netflix have more of?
#### - How much content was released by year?
#### - What is the percentage of content released by year?
#### - What are the number of movies and tv shows produced by year? 
#### - Which country has the most number of produced content?
#### - What MPAA rating is the most common across the Netflix offerings?
#### - What director has the most content on Netflix?
#### - When was the most Netflix content produced?
#### - Which countries produce Netflix content?
#### - How are MPAA ratings distributed throughout the years?
